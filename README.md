# dotfiles  ðŸ’¾

Aggregation of dotFiles in one place and powered by [dotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

After cloning this repo, run install to automatically set up the development environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.

The set up was inspired from the [blog post](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/)
