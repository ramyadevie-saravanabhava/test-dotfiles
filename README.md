# dotfiles  ðŸ’¾

Aggregation of dotFiles powered by [dotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

After cloning this repo, run install to automatically set up the development environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.

The set up was inspired from the [blog post](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/)

## Index of Configuration Available
- Vim/Neovim
- Tmux
- Git
- Fish
- Hammerspoon
- Karabinar(mac only)
- iTerm
- Fresh MacOS setup script

## Quick Start

To quickly setup the configurations, clone this repository

```git
git clone https://github.com/yuujay/dotfiles
```

Once cloned `cd` into the `dotfiles` directory and run the install script

```sh
sh install
```

If everything goes well, you have the symlinks established for your `rc` and `config` files.

## Major TODO's
- [ ] Ansible for MacOS setup script
- [ ] Hammerspoon dual monitor configs
- [ ] Update detailed docs
- [ ] Directory specific README
